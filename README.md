Basic but decent shiny app

Created using the basic shiny package and fluidrows.

Data visualization of National Teams Soccer results from: https://www.kaggle.com/tarique81/comparison-of-brazil-argentina-int-football/data

Rproject file is present but you can run the app by running first the transformation script, followed by the tabs and server scripts. Ending wit the shinyapp script.
